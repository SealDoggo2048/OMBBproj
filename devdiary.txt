Prototyping Phase - Game Mechanics
Movement:
	Jumping done through raytracing
	Crouching and sprinting as other options
Shooting:
	Projectile not hitscan

Feedback:
	Fun but more speed

	Need more verticality

Alpha Phase - Project Appearance
I can't model to save my life, so everything will be beans and cubes
Also use those nice blueprint textures
Different colours for each big feature
Big minimap TL
Score TR

Feedback:
	Better with larger map but needs more enemies

	Score good but objective very high

Beta Phase - Screens
Start screen is the pause menu open at start
No credits screen needed
No loading screens needed (but I put a seal at the start)

Feedback:
	Faster sprint speed is more fun

	Make sure enemies despawn
		- Added killbox and reset mechanic

Beta Phase - Final
Start screen is done, no credits or loading screens needed
Pause screen tells everything
It has sound effects (I hope I can't hear them because there's no speakers)
I have revised my project based on feedback


Release Phase - Playtesting
Feedback:
	Need some form of pressure on player
		- Added timer

	Movement is fun
